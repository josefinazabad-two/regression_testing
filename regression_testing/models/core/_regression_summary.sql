{#- /*
    materialized="table"
    probably switch over to a table for speed as this view is slow
    depends a bit on how I want to interact with it
    advantage of a view is that I don't have to ensure that it is built last after
    everything else & it's up to date when I query it
    advantage of a table is that it is fast to review
