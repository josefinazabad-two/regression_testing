{#- /*
--  Filename: expected_cases_s10.sql
--  Author: Jared Church <jared.church@healthsourcenz.co.nz>

--  Purpose:
--      Defines the expected standard test cases
--      Test cases are defined against a table type and column type
--      support test cases for text data types, primary and foreign keys

--  Primary Key:
--      a.table_schema ,a.table_name ,a.column_name ,e.test_type

--  Technical Debt
--      there is some question of the boolean
--      test being not_null (defined in reference file)
--      should the unknown row of a dim being not
--      null - for a fact I think it should be not null
--      just the unknown row of a dim that is in question

--  History
--      2024-04-16: churchj2: Was missing expected cases if a column
--                            didn't exist (e.g. skey not there).
--                            This resolves that.
