        description: |
          count of the number of nodes related to this test - should be 1 or 2.
          this test may go away/be adjusted for types of test as there are at least
          some cases where the value is not 1 or 2. Specifically the po_structure_consistency
          case is 4 nodes, and if a AP invoice consistency test gets added that will
          likely be 3 nodes. An alternative if we wanted to fix the rule to the 1 or 2
          then we create a staging object that connects all the nodes and then have the
          test just reference the staging object then it's only 1 node for the test.
