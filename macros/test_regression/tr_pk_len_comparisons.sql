{# /*
--  Filename: tr_pk_len_comparisons.sql
--  Author: Badi James <badi.james@healthsourcenz.co.nz , badij@acumenbi.co.nz>
--
--  Purpose:
--      Creates a view that compares row count and intersection of primary key 
--      values for each object where the test version does not match the gold version

--  Notes:
--      Refers to the object created by tr_table_comparisons to find mismatched
--      objects, hence should be run after tr_table_comparisons

--  Tech Debt:
--      The may be an issue where no results to compare - possible scenario
--      optimising a staging table with no output impact.

--      I think that this needs to include schema for object name when it builds
--      this table - that is then used in tr_column_comparisons to resolve
--      and correctly identify the part of columns in both that is of interest.

--      Probably should have schema name passed as a variable for which objects
--      to test rather than filtering where a column _INCLUDE_REGRESSION exists
--      (which is probably not correct as that column indicates rows for
--      inclusion in regression test, not tables - see additional comments below).
